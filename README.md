# [Analyzing-Millions-of-NYC-Parking-Violations](https://github.com/OjeWilliams/Analyzing-Millions-of-NYC-Parking-Violations)

This project involves interacting and analyzing NYC parking violations over the last decade through the Socrata Open Data API. To achieve this I utilized a EC2 instance from Amazon Web Services, the Linux terminal, Docker, Elasticsearch and finally Kibana.

Parking tickets are a headache for most people but for some states it's a tremendous money maker with them raking in millions if not billions in fees and fines. Luckily, we are afforded a chance to analyze this data through NYC Open Data which is a free public data site which offers an api for this very purpose. The Open Parking and Camera Violations api is a very large data source that can be much more easily and efficiently handled through cloud computing and thats what we plan to do here. <br />

# [Analyzing Yelp Reviews Dataset](https://github.com/OjeWilliams/Analyzing-Yelp-Reviews-Dataset/blob/main/README.md)
 This project involves diving into a dataset of [Yelp](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) reviews and seeing what interesting things we can find. The dataset is a collection of Yelp's reviews, user data and businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada. The Yelp Dataset is a great resource for us to Extract, Load and Transform as a Big Data project. The dataset is quite large (11gb) and therefore to investigate it we will leverage a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR for loading the data as well as an S3 bucket for uploading the data while all analysis was completed using Pyspark, SQL inside a Jupyter Notebook. 
As part of the analysis I investigated the skewness of the data as well as the trustworthyness of Elite reviews.
