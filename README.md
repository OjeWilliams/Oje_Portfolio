# [Analyzing-Millions-of-NYC-Parking-Violations](https://github.com/OjeWilliams/Analyzing-Millions-of-NYC-Parking-Violations)

This project involves interacting and analyzing NYC parking violations over the last decade through the Socrata Open Data API. To achieve this I utilized a EC2 instance from Amazon Web Services, the Linux terminal, Docker, Elasticsearch and finally Kibana.

Parking tickets are a headache for most people but for some states it's a tremendous money maker with them raking in millions if not billions in fees and fines. Luckily, we are afforded a chance to analyze this data through NYC Open Data which is a free public data site which offers an api for this very purpose. The Open Parking and Camera Violations api is a very large data source that can be much more easily and efficiently handled through cloud computing and thats what we plan to do here.
